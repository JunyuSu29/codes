#To solve complex problems, first understand and interpret the parts of a problem. Also, read carefully what the specific inputs and outputs should be.
#Then, start to write a idea for how to solve the problem using human language. 
#When there is a full picture in your mind, start writing the code.
#After finishing the code, test some cases and debug. 
#Finally, after the code works, check for the format of the code and the understandivity of the code, and remove any unnecessary steps.
